/**
 * Shrinks the choice sequence of a counterexample: it repeatedly tries
 * simpler choice sequences and keeps one when replaying it fails in the
 * same way.
 *
 * The shrinker works on choice sequences only. It neither knows the
 * generators that build values from the choices nor how a candidate is
 * checked, so composed generators shrink as well as the ones they are
 * composed of.
 *
 * Its passes are deleting spans, while the references after a span are
 * changed so that they keep referring to the same values, and an element
 * that the minimum size of a collection requires is deleted together with
 * the choice that added the first other element (see SpanKind),
 * replacing spans with shorter spans they
 * contain that have the same label, moving the values of spans that consist
 * of one choice into the later values of spans with the same label as far
 * as these can take them, setting blocks of consecutive choices to 0,
 * deleting blocks of choices, minimizing individual choices by trying
 * small values and then searching for the smallest value with a binary
 * search, redistributing pairs of nearby choices by moving as much as
 * possible from the first choice to the second, lowering a choice while
 * raising a later one to its largest value and minimizing the raised choice
 * right away, lowering a choice while deleting
 * as many spans of a group of spans that are part of the same span and have
 * the same label after it, lowering equal choices together, and sorting the
 * spans that are part of the same span and have the same label. The passes
 * are repeated until none of them succeeds, the maximum number of attempts
 * has been made, or shrinking is interrupted. Each round of passes starts
 * with the passes that made the counterexample simpler most often in the
 * round before, so that the attempts are spent on the passes that are most
 * likely to succeed.
 *
 * Only when none of these passes succeeds, choices are lowered in steps: by
 * a small amount, or by a power of two or of ten, and then by as many
 * multiples of the amount that kept the counterexample failing as possible.
 * This finds the smallest counterexample of a property that depends on the
 * remainder of a division, for which a binary search ends at a value that
 * only happens to fail. It needs attempts that are made in vain for every
 * other property, which is why the other passes are tried first. When it
 * succeeds, the other passes are repeated. A choice is lowered in steps right
 * away when a binary search lowers it below a value that is known not to
 * keep the counterexample failing, as only such a property allows that.
